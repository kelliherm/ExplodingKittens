# Exploding Kittens Rules

The goal of Exploding Kittens is to be the last player standing. To do this, one must avoid drawing any of the Exploding Kitten cards from the deck. Each player has a hand of cards that they may use in order to prevent themselves from drawing an Exploding Kitten.

## Setup

 1. Remove all of the Exploding Kittens and Defuse cards from the deck.
 2. Shuffle all of the remaining cards, and deal 4 cards to each player.
 3. Deal 1 Defuse card to each player, giving everybody a hand of 5 cards. Players should keep their hand a secret from other players.
 4. Insert a number of Exploding Kitten cards in the deck equal to one less than the number of players in the game.
 5. Insert any extra Defuse cards that have not already been dealt back into the deck. If only two players are playing the game, put only 2 Defuse cards back into the deck. Discard the other 2 from the game.
 6. Shuffle the deck and place in face down in the center of the playing surface. This deck becomes the draw pile.
 7. A random player goes first and then gameplay moves clockwise.

## Gameplay

 1. Players may play a card from their hand **face up** on the discard pile. Follow any instructions on the card. Players may choose to not play any cards if they choose.

## Advanced Play

### Two of a Kind

You may steal a random card from any player, naming the player that you would like to steal from. This can be done with any two a kind, not just using the powerless cards. Cards are then placed in the discard pile.

### Three of a Kind

Similar to the Two of a Kind rule, but you may name the card that you would like from another player. If they have the card, the a required to give it to you, and if they don't have the card you get nothing.

### 5 Different Cards

If you play 5 cards that all have a different symbol, you may go through the discard pile and choose any card for your own hand.

## Additional Rules

 - On their turn, players may also count the number of cards remaining in the Draw Pile.
 - There is no need to shuffle the Draw Pile, the number of cards in it will never reach 0 before the game ends.
 - There is no minimum hand size, players just draw during their turn.
